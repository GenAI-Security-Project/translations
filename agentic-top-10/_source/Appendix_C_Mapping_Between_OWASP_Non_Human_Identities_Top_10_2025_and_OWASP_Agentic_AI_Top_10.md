# Appendix C - Mapping Between OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10 (2025) and OWASP Agentic AI Top 10

The table below maps the OWASP Non-Human Identities (NHI) Top 10 (2025) risks to the OWASP Agentic AI

Top 10 (ASI), Agentic-AI Threats & Mitigations (T-codes), and AIVSS Core Risk categories to show alignment

between identity-centric and agentic-behavior-centric risks.
